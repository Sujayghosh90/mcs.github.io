        The school was established by people of Midnapore. With the economic help of Tezchandra Mehtab Raybahadur,[3] the school had started its journey with a few thatched huts and 18 students. The first headmaster was Rasiklal Sen and after just two years, the school got the honour of <strong>Governmental Zilla School</strong> in 1836. When Calcutta University was established in 1857, the school came under its supervision.During the time of British Headmasters Sir F. Tydd and Mr. Sinclare, their thought about teaching was,"the interrogative system of teaching should be carefully pursued during every step of the scholar's progress as the simplest and most effectual means of conveying knowledge." 'Sahityasamrat' of Bengal, Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and his elder brother studied here.
